abstract = {Individual atomic and subatomic particles may be observed over long periods by confining them in “traps without material walls”. The Nobel Prize in physics was awarded in 1989 to Hans Dehmelt and Wolfgang Paul (together with Nor-man F. Ramsey) for first introducing this concept. Such traps are made possible by extending the principles of two-dimensional focusing of particles to three dimensions. This led, in turn, to precision radiofrequency spectroscopy and quadrupole mass spectrometry. For example, side-band cooling, in which electrons absorb photons with an energy just below the resonance energy and use their kinetic energy to supply the balance, allowed an electron to be held for ten months in the center of a magnetic trap. In this way, ½ g was determined to be 1.001159652188(4).},

title={An optical atomic clock based on a highly charged ion},
journal={Nature},

day={01},
volume={611},
number={7934},
pages={43-47},
abstract={Optical atomic clocks are the most accurate measurement devices ever constructed and have found many applications in fundamental science and technology1--3. The use of highly charged ions (HCI) as a new class of references for highest-accuracy clocks and precision tests of fundamental physics4--11 has long been motivated by their extreme atomic properties and reduced sensitivity to perturbations from external electric and magnetic fields compared with singly charged ions or neutral atoms. Here we present the realization of this new class of clocks, based on an optical magnetic-dipole transition in Ar13+. Its comprehensively evaluated systematic frequency uncertainty of 2.2{\thinspace}{\texttimes}{\thinspace}10−17 is comparable with that of many optical clocks in operation. From clock comparisons, we improve by eight and nine orders of magnitude on the uncertainties for the absolute transition frequency12 and isotope shift (40Ar versus 36Ar) (ref. 13), respectively. These measurements allow us to investigate the largely unexplored quantum electrodynamic (QED) nuclear recoil, presented as part of improved calculations of the isotope shift, which reduce the uncertainty of previous theory14 by a factor of three. This work establishes forbidden optical transitions in HCI as references for cutting-edge optical clocks and future high-sensitivity searches for physics beyond the standard model.},

pages={709-711},
abstract={Among the numerous types of architecture being explored for quantum computers are systems utilizing ion traps, in which quantum bits (qubits) are formed from the electronic states of trapped ions and coupled through the Coulomb interaction. Although the elementary requirements for quantum computation have been demonstrated in this system, there exist theoretical and technical obstacles to scaling up the approach to large numbers of qubits. Therefore, recent efforts have been concentrated on using quantum communication to link a number of small ion-trap quantum systems. Developing the array-based approach, we show how to achieve massively parallel gate operation in a large-scale quantum computer, based on techniques already demonstrated for manipulating small quantum registers. The use of decoherence-free subspaces significantly reduces decoherence during ion transport, and removes the requirement of clock synchronization between the interaction regions.},

               spectroscopy",
  author    = "Kj{\ae}r, Christina and Langeland, Jeppe and Lindkvist, Thomas
               Toft and S{\o}rensen, Emma Rostal and Stockett, Mark H and
               Kjaergaard, Henrik G and Nielsen, Steen Br{\o}ndsted",
  abstract  = "Here, we present a new instrument named LUNA2 (LUminescence
               iNstrument in Aarhus 2), which is purpose-built to measure
               dispersed fluorescence spectra of gaseous ions produced by
               electrospray ionization and cooled to low temperatures (<100 K).
               LUNA2 is, as an earlier room-temperature setup (LUNA), optimized
               for a high collection efficiency of photons and includes
               improvements based on our operational experience with LUNA. The
               fluorescence cell is a cylindrical Paul trap made of copper with
               a hole in the ring electrode to permit laser light to interact
               with the trapped ions, and one end-cap electrode is a mesh grid
               combined with an aspheric condenser lens. The entrance and exit
               electrodes are both in physical contact with the liquid-nitrogen
               cooling unit to reduce cooling times. Mass selection is done in
               a two-step scheme where, first, high-mass ions are ejected
               followed by low-mass ions according to the Mathieu stability
               region. This scheme may provide a higher mass resolution than
               when only one DC voltage is used. Ions are irradiated by visible
               light delivered from a nanosecond 20-Hz pulsed laser, and
               dispersed fluorescence is measured with a spectrometer combined
               with an iCCD camera that allows intensification of the signal
               for a short time interval. LUNA2 contains an additional Paul
               trap that can be used for mass selection before ions enter the
               fluorescence cell, which potentially is relevant to diminishing
               RF heating in the cold trap. Successful operation of the setup
               is demonstrated from experiments with rhodamine dyes and
               oxazine-4, and spectral changes with temperature are identified.",

abstract = {Electrospray ionization has recently emerged as a powerful technique for producing intact ions in vacuo from large and complex species in solution. To an extent greater than has previously been possible with the more familiar "soft" ionization methods, this technique makes the power and elegance of mass spectrometric analysis applicable to the large and fragile polar molecules that play such vital roles in biological systems. The distinguishing features of electrospray spectra for large molecules are coherent sequences of peaks whose component ions are multiply charged, the ions of each peak differing by one charge from those of adjacent neighbors in the sequence. Spectra have been obtained for biopolymers including oligonucleotides and proteins, the latter having molecular weights up to 130,000, with as yet no evidence of an upper limit.}}

abstract  ="A flexible interface to perform optical spectroscopic measurements on gaseous ions stored in a modified commercial quadrupole ion trap (QIT) mass spectrometer is described. The modifications made to the mass spectrometer did not adversely affect its operating characteristics. Gas-phase ions are produced using electrospray ionization{,} mass isolated and stored in the trapping mass spectrometer. The ions are subsequently irradiated with visible light from a tunable laser and dispersed fluorescence spectra are recorded simultaneously. Mass spectra are recorded after the irradiation period. This set-up allows us to track a range of possible outcomes upon photoexcitation of selected ions including fluorescence{,} photofragmentation and photodetachment of electrons. The experimental set-up is characterized using rhodamine 590{,} which is a methyl ester variant of rhodamine 6G. Fluorescence excitation and emission spectra of gaseous rhodamine 590 are measured and compared with solution-phase spectra. Excitation and emission maxima for the gaseous ions are found to lie at higher energy than for the solvated rhodamine 590. In addition{,} the gas-phase Stokes shift is significantly smaller than the solution-phase Stokes shift. The effects of several experimental parameters on the observed fluorescence signal are investigated{,} including laser power{,} relative number of ions{,} qz trapping parameter and buffer gas pressure. In addition to its use for the photophysical characterization of the intrinsic properties of ionic chromophores{,} this set-up may be used to investigate the properties of mass-selected{,} dye-labeled biomolecules{,} both alone and in well-defined complexes and clusters."}
